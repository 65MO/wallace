### **Component: Process Environmental Data**

**ORIENTATION**

Environmental data may be processed in many ways for niche/distributional modeling. At present, Component **Process Environmental Data** addresses one critical step: selecting a study region for analysis. This determines the spatial extent for model building, as well as the environmental characteristics of the data used for comparison with records of the species’ presence (e.g., the ‘background’ data; Anderson and Raza 2010). By doing so, it also sets the range (and combinations) of environmental conditions associated with model building, allowing later flagging of ‘non-analogous’ conditions (e.g., when applying a model to another region or time period; some Williams citation from MS). *Wallace* provides three alternative ways for delimiting a study region as options under Module ***Select Study Region***: 1) a rectangular “bounding box” , 2) a polygon that connects the most spatially extreme records (minimum convex hull); or 3) upload of a user-provided polygon. All these polygons can be spatially buffered by degree.
