Welcome to **Wallace**, a web app that guides users through a species distribution modeling analysis. Species distribution models (SDMs) make predictions of species potential geographic distributions using data on species occurrences and the environment at these places. The "potential geographic distribution" can be thought of as all areas on the landscape that would potentially be suitable for the species, before accounting for factors like the ability of the species to reach these places, or the presence or absence of other species that positively or negatively impact the species. We dedicate this software to Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection and the founder of the field of biogeography.

Predictions of SDMs, depending on the methods and data incorporated, can also be used as a measure of landscape suitability for the species, even for areas that are far away from places the species has been found to date. SDMs are especially useful for helping to refine species range estimates, figuring out which environmental variables are most responsible for delimiting ranges, discover previously unknown populations of a species, and generate hypotheses about how species that live nearby interact with each other. SDMs can also be projected to other times using data from climate models. These predictions have applications such as forecasting where species may move with ongoing climate change, and estimating how species environmental preferences may change through time. There are a multitude of applications for SDMs, spanning the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, conservation, forestry, agriculture, and more.

**Wallace** is a central hub for many of the tools modelers use to build and evaluate SDMs: data cleaning routines, mapping functions, model evaluation procedures, plotting functions, and spatial analysis. **Wallace** is entirely programmed in R. Please find a schematic below explaining the recommended workflow.
