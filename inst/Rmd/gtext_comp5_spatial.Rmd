### **Module:** ***Non-spatial Partition***

**BACKGROUND**

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

**IMPLEMENTATION**

Module ***Spatial Partition*** implements functionalities from the R package `ENMeval` to partition the occurrence localities into training and testing datasets (using development version v0.1.2, available on Github). The user can choose one of three means of spatial partitioning: the block, checkerboard1, or checkerboard2 options. These partitions have k = either 2 or 4 folds/groups. For each option in this module, the number of datasets produced is equal to k, with each dataset having both training and testing localities.
