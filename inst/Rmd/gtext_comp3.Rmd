**ORIENTATION**

In order to model the relationship between species occurrences and the environment, in addition to the occurrence data just collected and processed, algorithms for niche/distributional modeling require environmental predictor variables. Component **Obtain Environmental Data** allows users to harness these variables from sources on the Internet in the form of raster grids. In recent times, a number of global-scale databases of climate data have emerged (Hijmans et al. 2005, Kriticos et al. 2012, Sbrocco and Barber 2013). Currently, *Wallace* offers access to present-day averaged climate data from the WorldClim dataset, which has global coverage of terrestrial areas (Module ***WorldClim***). We envision that future releases will offer other climate datasets with different variables (e.g. CliMond), temporal resolution (e.g PRISM), and biome focus (e.g. MARSPEC), and also allow upload of user-provided sets of environmental grids.
