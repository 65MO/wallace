The first step is to download occurrence data (e.g. from GBIF; duplicate records are removed). After acquiring these points, it is useful to examine them on a map.

Such datasets can contain errors; as a preliminary method of data-cleaning, here the user can specify records to be removed. Additionally, the user can download the records as a CSV file.

Future versions will allow the user to download occurrence records from other databases, as well as upload their own occurrence records as an alternate option.
