In this module, only selected points are used in proceeding analyses. Either remove by record ID, or select points to keep with a polygon. CLICK on the map to draw a polygon, then press "Select Points" to select the points it overlaps. You can then draw another polygon and select other points, and repeat this process until all the points you want to include in the analysis are selected. If you want to reset, just press "Erase Polygons".
