**BACKGROUND**  
In addition to varying greatly among algorithms or modeling approaches (e.g., BIOCLIM, Maxent, GAM, BRT; (Elith et al. 2006), the output of niche/distribution models depends on the settings of an individual algorithm. Settings affecting the level of model complexity can hold especially strong influence on model output, and such sensitivity is well documented for Maxent ((Elith et al. 2010; Merow et al. 2013; Shcheglovitova and Anderson 2013; Radosavljevic and Anderson 2014)). For these reasons, evaluating model quality and estimating optimal model complexity constitute important elements of a niche/distributional modeling study with Maxent.  
 
**IMPLEMENTATION**  
This module uses the R packages ENMeval and dismo to build and evaluate Maxent niche/distributional models across a wide range of model settings (Muscarella et al. 2014). It automates two workflows: 1) building a suite of candidate models with differing limitations on complexity; and 2) quantifying their performance. Regarding the first, it makes models with various combinations of feature classes (e.g., linear, quadratic, hinge) and regularization multipliers (higher values provide stronger penalties for parameters included in the model, and hence they tend to lead to simpler models, with fewer variables included in the final model). The field remains far from any consensus regarding model evaluation and estimation of optimal model complexity (especially for presence-background datasets like those used in Maxent). Nevertheless, the evaluation metrics provided here can aid the user in selecting optimal settings (Radosavljevic and Anderson 2014). A red progress bar appears near the top of the screen while Maxent analyses are being run.
