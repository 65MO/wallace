**BACKGROUND**  

Over the past two decades, the worldwide biodiversity informatics community has achieved remarkable progress, with many millions of species occurrence records now available online through various databases, including a substantial subset of records with assigned georeferences (e.g., latitude/longitude coordinates). These data document the presence of a species at particular points in space and time, along with other useful metadata fields when available (e.g. data source, elevation, etc.). The origin of much of this data is digitized collections from natural history museums and herbaria, although newer data sources such as mobile technology leveraged by citizen science initiatives are growing contributors as well.

**IMPLEMENTATION** 

The R package `spocc` provides *streamlined* access to many species occurrence databases, some of which aggregate data from myriad providers. Users can choose between three of the largest databases: <a href="http://www.gbif.org" target="_blank">GBIF</a>, <a href="http://www.vertnet.org" target="_blank">VertNet</a>, and <a href="https://bison.usgs.gov" target="_blank">BISON</a>. Records downloaded are restricted to those with georeferences, and records with duplicate coordinates are removed. This is because we are interested in independent occurrences, not indicators of abundance. The database query returns a data table that display several key fields, and users can download a .csv file of these records with all the original fields provided.
