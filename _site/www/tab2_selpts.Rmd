**BACKGROUND**  
<p align="justify">
Despite their great utility, aggregated biodiversity occurrence datasets typically contain errors both in identification and in georeferencing. Many but not all such errors can be spotted by simple visual inspection of the localities plotted on a map.  
</p>
**IMPLEMENTATION**
<p align="justify">
The module “Select Localities” allows users to specify the localities to be removed vs. retained, as a crude but useful method of data cleaning. This can be done by typing the ID numbers of the localities to be removed into a text box, and/or by selecting localities to retain by drawing polygons on the map. Rather than relying heavily on a single R package with the desired functionality, it draws on custom code that leverages the leaflet R package (v1.0.0.999).</p>
<p align="justify">
In this module, only selected points are used in proceeding analyses. Either remove by record ID, or select points to keep with a polygon. CLICK on the map to draw a polygon, then press "Select With Polygon" to select the points it overlaps. You can then draw another polygon and select other points, and repeat this process until all the points you want to include in the analysis are selected. If you want to reset, just press "Reset Localities".</p>
